## Machine Learning Models Context:

Repo to contain Machine Learning Models in raw format, written in python3 along with formulaes in mathematical formats. 

## Models: 

### 1. Decision Tree (Completed): 
A machine learning model that generated a tree, for decision making based on the feature and target dataset, predicting the target outcomes based on the input feature data filtered through the tree. 

### 2. Support Vector Machine (In Progress): 
A machine learning model that works on single to third dimensional datasets, used for clustering or separating the datasets into two or more similar groups using a point (1D), straight line (2D) or hyperplane (3D), making an cluster for common data groups.
